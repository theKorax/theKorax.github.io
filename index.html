            Hi, I am Zikora. I am a developer exploring digital immersion and intelligence. I am focused on building at the intersection of <strong><span style="color: #4279b0;">MACHINE LEARNING</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: #4279b0;">DATA SCIENCE</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #4279b0;">GAME DEVELOPMENT</span></strong>, with a strong interest in applied Artificial Intelligence across education, healthcare, and entertainment. Building on a solid foundation in Data Science and Analytics, I apply methods and techniques in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing alongside skills in Python and R statistical programming, SQL database management, and data visualization with tools like Pandas, to display insightful patterns and predictions that make a difference. My portfolio reflects my commitment to creating solutions; a by-product of my desire to leave the world a better place than I met it. Explore the rest of my portfolio to see how I apply my passion to create real-world solutions, and feel free to connect with me to delve into anything I have mentioned that resonates with you.

                        This project served as my undergraduate thesis and was undertaken to investigate the limits of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in evaluating non-objective human input. It integrates the automated grading system into a demo online learning platform, with test questions and instructor-provided answers which the grading system compares against the "student"-provided input.

                        A 2D platformer built with Unity, where players take on the role of a scientist solving math and science equations to progress through levels while facing AI-controlled enemies. Designed as an educational yet entertaining experience, the game was developed as a demo featuring two playable levels. It was created by Zikora Chuks-Nwosu and Oluwasegun Tobi as the final project for the GameUp Africa bootcamp, blending learning with engaging gameplay.
